# NYC-taxi-data-analysis
Data cleaning and visualization with python | Data analysis with SQL

Authors: Jiacheng Zhou, Leon Lou


## Introduction
In this project, we analyzed the New York City (NYC) taxi trip data and uber trip data from 2009 to 2015. Topics include the most popular hour during the day, the impact of weather on hired trips and popular hired trip destination in NYC.

We use python to download and clean data. The data is stored in a SQLite database and analzyed with SQL queries. Visualizations are provided using Python.
